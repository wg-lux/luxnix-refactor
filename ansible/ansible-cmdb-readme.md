Getting started

Links to the full documentation can be found below, but here's a rough indication of how Ansible-cmdb works to give you an idea:

    Install Ansible-cmdb from source, a release package or through pip: pip install ansible-cmdb.

    Fetch your host's facts through ansible:

     $ mkdir out
     $ ansible -m setup --tree out/ all

Generate the CMDB HTML with Ansible-cmdb:

$ ansible-cmdb out/ > overview.html

    Open overview.html in your browser.

That's it! Please do read the full documentation on usage, as there are some caveats to how you can use the generated HTML.
